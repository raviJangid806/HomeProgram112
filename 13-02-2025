1. SQL Query Execution Flow
a. Complete: Studied the internal execution process of SQL queries, covering:

Parsing, optimization, and execution plan generation.

Role of indexes and query performance tuning.

Impact of transactions and locking mechanisms.
b. Key Learning: Improved my ability to write optimized SQL queries and understand their execution flow within the database engine.

a. Complete: Reviewed key JPA and Hibernate annotations used in entity mapping, including:

Basic Entity Annotations:

@Entity, @Table, @Id, @GeneratedValue, @Column (for defining tables and fields).

@Transient, @Lob, @Enumerated, @CreationTimestamp, @UpdateTimestamp.


Embedded & Inheritance Mapping:

@Embedded & @Embeddable (for composite keys and reusable value types).
