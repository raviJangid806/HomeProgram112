**Subject:** Summary of Today's Learning

**Topics Learned Today:**

**1. Spring Boot Mockito**  
   a. Complete: Mockito is a testing framework used to create mock objects and simulate dependencies during unit testing.  
   b. Key Learning: I learned how to use Mockito with Spring Boot to mock services and repositories, allowing isolated testing of business logic without relying on actual implementations.

**2. Annotations in Spring**  
   a. Complete: Annotations in Spring simplify the configuration and management of components within the application.  
   b. Key Learning: I learned about various annotations like `@Autowired`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Component`, and how they facilitate dependency injection and component scanning in Spring.

**3. Slice in REST**  
   a. Complete: Slice testing is a focused testing approach that allows testing only a specific layer of the application, such as the web, service, or data layer.  
   b. Key Learning: I learned how to use Spring Bootâ€™s slice annotations, like `@WebMvcTest`, to test the web layer separately without loading the entire application context.

**4. MockMvc Framework**  
   a. Complete: MockMvc is a tool used to test Spring MVC controllers by simulating HTTP requests and verifying the responses.  
   b. Key Learning: I learned how to use the MockMvc framework to write unit tests for REST APIs, simulate GET and POST requests, and validate response status, headers, and content without deploying the entire application.
