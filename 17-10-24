**Subject:** Summary of Today's Learning

**Topics Learned Today:**

**1. Batch Processing**  
   a. Complete: Batch processing involves processing large amounts of data in chunks.  
   b. Key Learning: I learned the complete flow of batch processing in Spring, from reading data to processing and writing it. I also explored key annotations and components such as:
   - `@EnableBatchProcessing`: Enables batch processing features.
   - `JobBuilder` and `StepBuilder`: Used for building jobs and steps in batch processing.
   - `FlatFileItemReader`: Reads data from flat files like CSV.
   - Line Mapper: Maps each line from a file to a data object.
   - Job: The central element that represents the batch process.

**2. Scheduler**  
   a. Complete: Scheduling allows tasks to be executed at specific times automatically.  
   b. Key Learning: I learned how to set up scheduled tasks in Spring Boot, ensuring that batch processes or other operations can run automatically at defined intervals.
