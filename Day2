**Subject:** Update on Today's REST API Study Progress

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share an update on the topics I studied today related to REST API architecture. Below is a summary of my progress and key learnings:

1. **REST API Architecture**
   - **Completed**: [Explain what you completed, e.g., "I explored the fundamentals of REST API architecture, including its principles and design patterns."]
   - **Key Learning**: [Share what you learned, e.g., "I learned how REST APIs use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to manage resources, and the importance of stateless communication between client and server."]

2. **Model Mapper**
   - **Completed**: [Describe what you covered, e.g., "I implemented Model Mapper to simplify object mapping between DTOs and entities in my Spring application."]
   - **Key Learning**: [Explain what you learned, e.g., "I learned how Model Mapper can reduce boilerplate code and improve the maintainability of code when converting between different object types."]

3. **HTTP Status Codes**
   - **Completed**: [Detail your progress, e.g., "I studied the various HTTP status codes and their significance in REST API responses."]
   - **Key Learning**: [Describe your key takeaways, e.g., "I learned the proper usage of status codes like 200 (OK), 201 (Created), 400 (Bad Request), 401 (Unauthorized), and 404 (Not Found) to indicate the success or failure of an API request."]
