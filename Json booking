Your `User` entity class is well-structured and includes essential fields with appropriate annotations for JPA. Below, Iâ€™ll provide a complete JSON representation for the `User` class based on your current structure.

### Sample User JSON

Here's how a JSON object for the `User` class could look:

```json
{
    "id": 101,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "johndoe@example.com",
    "password": "securePassword123"
}
```


{
    "id": 501,
    "title": "Annual Tech Conference",
    "description": "A conference for tech enthusiasts to explore the latest in technology.",
    "dateTime": "2024-11-01T10:00:00",  // ISO 8601 format for LocalDateTime
    "location": "Convention Center",
    "availableSeats": 100
}

### Breakdown of the JSON fields:
- **`id`**: Unique identifier for the user (typically generated by the database).
- **`name`**: The name of the user.
- **`email`**: The email address of the user, which must be unique.
- **`password`**: The user's password (make sure to handle this securely in your application).

### Notes:
- When working with user passwords, ensure you follow best practices for security. Do **not** store plain-text passwords in your database. Instead, consider hashing passwords before storing them using a library like BCrypt.
- Make sure the structure of your JSON matches the entity's expected structure to avoid serialization errors.
