**Subject:** Update on Today's Study Progress

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share an update on the topics I studied today. Below is a summary of my progress and key learnings:

1. **@ModelMapper**
   - **Completed**: I worked on integrating the @ModelMapper annotation to efficiently map data between DTOs and entities in my application.
   - **Key Learning**: I learned how @ModelMapper simplifies object mapping, reduces boilerplate code, and enhances code readability when handling complex objects in a Spring application.

2. **@ModelAttribute**
   - **Completed**: I practiced using the @ModelAttribute annotation to bind request data to model attributes in controllers.
   - **Key Learning**: I learned how @ModelAttribute helps streamline the handling of form data and binds data directly to objects, simplifying the passing of data between the view and controller.

3. **@RequestParam**
   - **Completed**: I used the @RequestParam annotation to capture query parameters and map them to controller method parameters.
   - **Key Learning**: I gained a better understanding of how @RequestParam makes it easy to handle and pass parameters from HTTP requests, enhancing the flexibility of my Spring MVC applications.

4. **Login and Signup Pages with Backend Functionality**
   - **Completed**: I created login and signup pages along with their backend functionality, including user authentication and form validation.
   - **Key Learning**: I learned how to integrate form submission with backend logic to securely handle user registration and login, using Spring Boot for backend processing and validation.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need more details on the topics I covered.
