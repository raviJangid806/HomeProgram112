hope youâ€™re doing well.I am reaching out to request a work-from-home arrangement from October 28th to October 31st, in light of the Diwali festivities. This would give me the opportunity to spend meaningful time with my family during this important celebration.I am fully aware that this may require adjustments to my workload and team coordination. Rest assured, I am committed to maintaining seamless communication and ensuring that my tasks are completed on time, so our team's momentum remains unaffected.I appreciate your consideration of this request and your continued support. Thank you for your understanding.
