By leveraging technologies such as Spring Boot, MySQL, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Thymeleaf, this platform ensures a user-friendly interface, robust backend performance, and scalability for future needs. The use of cookies allows cart data to persist for guests, while logged-in users' data syncs with the database for cross-browser accessibility.

This comprehensive approach caters to the needs of customers, shop owners, and administrators, providing a seamless and efficient e-commerce experience.
