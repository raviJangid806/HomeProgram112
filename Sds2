Existing System

The current system lacks a dedicated platform for managing book sales efficiently. Customers have no centralized way to browse, compare, and purchase books. Shop owners rely on manual processes for inventory management, such as maintaining stock and tracking orders, which can lead to errors and inefficiencies. Admins have limited or no tools for managing shop owners, customers, or products systematically. Additionally, there is no integration of advanced features such as bulk product uploads, automated notifications, or role-based access control, making it challenging to manage operations effectively. Overall, the existing system is fragmented, time-consuming, and lacks the scalability needed for a modern e-commerce platform.
