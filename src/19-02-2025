Subject: Summary of Today's Work

Topics Covered Today:

1. Executors and Their Internal Execution Flow
a. Complete: Studied the Executor Framework in Java, including:

Different types of executors (Executor, ExecutorService, ScheduledExecutorService).

Thread pool types (FixedThreadPool, CachedThreadPool, SingleThreadExecutor, WorkStealingPool).

Task submission (submit(), execute()) and lifecycle management (shutdown(), shutdownNow()).

Internal execution flow:

Task submission to the queue (e.g., LinkedBlockingQueue, SynchronousQueue).

Worker thread creation and management by ThreadPoolExecutor.

Handling rejected tasks via RejectedExecutionHandler.
b. Key Learning: Improved my understanding of how the Executor Framework manages thread pools, optimizes resource utilization, and handles concurrent tasks efficiently.
