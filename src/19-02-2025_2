Subject: Summary of Today's Work

Topics Covered Today:

1. Executors and Their Internal Execution Flow
a. Complete: Studied the Executor Framework in Java, covering:

Different types of executors (Executor, ExecutorService, ScheduledExecutorService).

Various thread pool implementations (FixedThreadPool, CachedThreadPool, SingleThreadExecutor, WorkStealingPool).

Task submission mechanisms (submit(), execute()) and lifecycle management (shutdown(), shutdownNow()).

Internal execution flow:

Task submission to the queue (e.g., LinkedBlockingQueue, SynchronousQueue).

Worker thread creation and management by ThreadPoolExecutor.

Handling rejected tasks via RejectedExecutionHandler.



b. Key Learning: Strengthened my knowledge of how Java manages concurrency efficiently, optimizes thread usage, and balances task execution.

2. Challenges Faced During Implementation

Thread Pool Saturation: Encountered issues where too many tasks were submitted, leading to thread starvation. Learned to properly configure pool size based on workload.

Task Rejection: Faced RejectedExecutionException when submitting tasks after shutdown. Resolved by handling rejected tasks with a proper strategy.

Deadlocks & Race Conditions: Experienced unintended blocking when multiple threads accessed shared resources. Fixed by using proper synchronization mechanisms.

Optimizing Performance: Initially used a SingleThreadExecutor, which caused delays. Switching to a FixedThreadPool improved performance significantly.
