Subject: Summary of Today's Work

Topics Covered Today:

1. Scheduled Executors and Their Internal Functionality
a. Complete: Studied the ScheduledExecutorService in Java, covering:

Different scheduling methods:

schedule() – Executes a task after a delay.

scheduleAtFixedRate() – Executes a task at a fixed rate, considering the start time.

scheduleWithFixedDelay() – Executes a task after a fixed delay between the completion of the previous execution and the start of the next.


Internal Execution Flow:

Tasks are submitted to a DelayQueue, which holds scheduled tasks until execution.

Worker threads pick tasks based on their scheduled execution time.

The ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor manages task execution and rescheduling.

Tasks can be canceled using Future.cancel(true).



b. Key Learning:

Gained a deep understanding of how ScheduledExecutorService manages recurring and delayed tasks.

Learned how to optimize scheduling for performance and resource efficiency.


2. Challenges Faced During Implementation

Task Overlapping: Faced issues where a task took longer than the fixed interval, leading to overlapping executions. Resolved by using scheduleWithFixedDelay() instead of scheduleAtFixedRate().

Thread Pool Exhaustion: Initially used an insufficient number of threads, causing delays in task execution. Fixed by increasing the pool size in newScheduledThreadPool().

Handling Task Cancellation: Had difficulty stopping scheduled tasks properly. Resolved using Future.cancel(true) to ensure immediate termination.

Memory Management: Learned that if not handled correctly, scheduled tasks can keep running indefinitely. Fixed by properly shutting down the executor using shutdown() and awaitTermination().
