Subject: Summary of Today's Work

Topics Covered Today:

1. JPA Revision in Spring Boot
a. Complete: Revisited key JPA concepts, including:

Entity Mapping: @Entity, @Table, @Column, @Id, @GeneratedValue.

Relationships: @OneToOne, @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @ManyToMany, @JoinColumn, @JoinTable.

Inheritance Strategies: @Inheritance, @DiscriminatorColumn, @MappedSuperclass.

Embedded Objects: @Embedded, @Embeddable.

Transaction Management: @Transactional and its impact on session handling.

Fetching Strategies: EAGER vs. LAZY loading.

Querying with JPA: @Query, NamedQuery, Criteria API, Specification.

Cascading and Orphan Removal: CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true.


b. Key Learning:

Improved understanding of how JPA simplifies database operations in Spring Boot.

Learned how to optimize entity relationships and fetching strategies for better performance.


2. Challenges Faced During Revision

LazyInitializationException: Encountered this issue when accessing a lazily loaded collection outside the transaction scope. Resolved by using @Transactional or JOIN FETCH queries.

N+1 Query Problem: Identified performance issues due to excessive queries and optimized them using @EntityGraph and proper fetching strategies.

Handling Bidirectional Relationships: Ensured proper mapping to avoid infinite loops in JSON responses by using @JsonIgnore or @JsonManagedReference/@JsonBackReference.

Database Schema Changes: Faced issues with schema auto-update when modifying entity structures. Resolved by properly handling spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto configurations.
